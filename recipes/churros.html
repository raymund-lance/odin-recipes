        pastry-predominantly choux- which is fried and dusted in cinnamon sugar.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>½ cup margarine</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Procedure</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a heavy deep skillet or deep-fryer, heat oil to 
                360 degrees F (180 degrees C). Oil should be about 1 1/2 inches deep.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a medium saucepan, heat water and margarine to a rolling boil. 
                Combine the flour and salt; stir into the boiling mixture.<br>
                Reduce heat to low and stir vigorously until the mixture forms a ball, about 1 minute. 
                Remove from heat and beat in the eggs one at a time.<br>
                Spoon the mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip.
            </li>
            <li>
                Carefully squeeze out 4 inch long strips of dough directly into the hot oil. 
                Fry 3 or 4 strips at once, until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side.<br>
                Remove from hot oil to drain on paper towels. Stir together the sugar and cinnamon; 
                roll churros in the mixture while still hot
            </li>
        </ol>
